 * before [hold] first emits are kept the same way, and a [hold] that completes releases for good.
 * The result completes once upstream has completed and nothing is still kept back. Nothing is
 * buffered between upstream and the collector, so a value passing through waits for the collector
 * to take it and upstream keeps the collector's pace.
